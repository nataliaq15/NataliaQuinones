			<p>Hi! My name is Natalia Quinones. I am currently 20 years old and I am from Amsterdam, New York. I am an American with Costa Rican heritage, so I take that with me everywhere I go. I am so grateful to have had such a loving and supporting family, no matter where I was in life they never stopped believing in me and they’re the reason why I am graduating college next spring and pursuing my dream career.</p>

		<p>Ever since I was born I always had a passion for drawing and design. I always enjoyed the creative and artistic projects assigned in school, and I realized that this field of study was what I wanted to do as a career in my junior year of highschool. I remember hearing a lot of people tell me that I wouldn’t be successful, that I would be a struggling artist and that there are better jobs out there. I want to show them and everyone that I am going to be successful. My goal is to prove them wrong.</p>
